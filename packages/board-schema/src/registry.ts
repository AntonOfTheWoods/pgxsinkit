 * - **Member** only reads both — `asReadonly` strips the local write machinery (no overlay/journal, no
 *   `client.tables.team{,_member}` write handle, no `_read_model` view) while preserving the read
 *   contract, so a member can never optimistically apply a write that RLS would only quarantine.
 *
